# About-Me
This repository gives a quick introduction about me as well as some examples of projects I've created or worked on.

I'm a recent graduate with a B.S. in Professional Computer Science from Middle Tennessee State University. My degree is accredited by Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. or ABET. I am interested in all aspects of sofware creation, testing, and debugging as well as database managment. I hope to master front end and back end technologies and hope to gain the skills to be a full-stack developper.
