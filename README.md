# About-Me
I'm a recent graduate with a B.S. in Professional Computer Science from Middle Tennessee State University. My degree is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. or ABET. I am interested in all aspects of sofware creation, testing, and debugging as well as database managment. I hope to master front end and back end technologies and hope to gain the skills to be a full-stack developper.

## About this repository
This repositiory will contain examples of source code that I've written as well as the language, platform, and environment that the project was created in. Each project will also contain a brief explanation of its purpose and funtionality as well.

###c++ Examples
These are a few programs written in c++ ranging from simple to fairly complex. Provided below are links to the source code along with a brief description of the program.

*[Simple BubbleSort](https://github.com/Dwright615/About-Me/blob/master/bubbleSort.cc "bubbleSort.cc")
    This is a simple program that implements a method "sort" that takes the number of elements of an Int array(Hard coded in this version) and then sorts the integers entered by the user into ascending order. Also there is a "swap" function implemented inside the "sort" fuction which uses the array adresses as arguments and pointers as local variables to swap values if necessary.
