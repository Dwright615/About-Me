# About-Me
This repository gives a quick introduction about me as well as some examples of projects I've created or worked on.

I'm a recent graduate with a B.S. in Professional Computer Science from Middle Tennessee State University. My degree is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. or ABET. I am interested in all aspects of sofware creation, testing, and debugging as well as database managment. I hope to master front end and back end technologies and hope to gain the skills to be a full-stack developper.

## About this repository
This repositiory will contain examples of source code that I've written as well as the language, platform, and environment that the project was created in. Each project will also contain a brief explanation of its purpose and funtionality as well.
